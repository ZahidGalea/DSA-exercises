Like two pointers, sliding windows work the same with arrays and strings - the important thing is that they're iterables
with ordered elements. For the sake of brevity, the first part of this article up until the examples will be focusing on
arrays. However, all the logic is identical for strings.

Subarrays
Given an array, a subarray is a contiguous section of the array. All the elements must be adjacent to each other in the original array and in their original order. For example, with the array [1, 2, 3, 4], the subarrays (grouped by length) are:

When should we use sliding window?
There is a very common group of problems involving subarrays that can be solved efficiently with sliding window. Let's talk about how to identify these problems.

First, the problem will either explicitly or implicitly define criteria that make a subarray "valid". There are 2 components regarding what makes a subarray valid:


```bash
function fn(nums, k):
    left = 0
    curr = 0
    answer = 0
    for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++):
        curr += nums[right]
        while (curr > k):
            curr -= nums[left]
            left++

        answer = max(answer, right - left + 1)

    return answer
```
```bash
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++):
        Do some logic to "add" element at arr[right] to window

        while WINDOW_IS_INVALID:
            Do some logic to "remove" element at arr[left] from window
            left++

        Do some logic to update the answer
```

```bash
def find_length(nums, k):
    # curr is the current sum of the window
    left = curr = ans = 0
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        curr += nums[right]
        while curr > k:
            curr -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
    
    return ans
```

Fixed Window Size:

```bash
function fn(arr, k):
    curr = some data to track the window

    // build the first window
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        Do something with curr or other variables to build first window

    ans = answer variable, probably equal to curr here depending on the problem
    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++)
        Add arr[i] to window
        Remove arr[i - k] from window
        Update ans

    return ans
```

```python
def find_best_subarray(nums, k):
    curr = 0
    for i in range(k):
        curr += nums[i]
    
    ans = curr
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        curr += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        ans = max(ans, curr)
    
    return ans
```
