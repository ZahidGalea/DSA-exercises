Two pointers is an extremely common technique used to solve array and string problems. 
It involves having two integer variables that both move along an iterable. In this article, we are focusing on arrays and strings. This means we will have two integers, usually named something like i and j, or left and right which each represent an index of the array or string.

```bash
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    right = arr.length - 1

    while left < right:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. left++
            2. right--
            3. Both left++ and right--
```

```python
def check_if_palindrome(s):
    left = 0
    right = len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return True

```

Another way to use two pointers
This method where we start the pointers at the first and last indices and move them towards each other is only one way to implement two pointers. Algorithms are beautiful because of how abstract they are - "two pointers" is just an idea, and it can be implemented in many different ways. Let's look at another method and some new examples. The following method is applicable when the problem has two iterables in the input, for example, two arrays.

```bash
function fn(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = 0
    while i < arr1.length AND j < arr2.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. i++
            2. j++
            3. Both i++ and j++

    // Step 4: make sure both iterables are exhausted
    // Note that only one of these loops would run
    while i < arr1.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        i++

    while j < arr2.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        j++
```

```python
def combine(arr1, arr2):
    # ans is the answer
    ans = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            ans.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            ans.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    
    while i < len(arr1):
        ans.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1
    
    while j < len(arr2):
        ans.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1
    
    return ans
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == len(s)
```
