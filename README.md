# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Project

This repository documents my journey learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains implementations of various algorithms and solutions to coding problems, focusing on understanding core computer science concepts and improving problem-solving skills.

## Learning Goals

1. Master common algorithmic patterns and techniques
2. Improve problem-solving skills through practical implementations
3. Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms
4. Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code

## Setup

This project uses Python 3.10.13. To get started:

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.10.13 installed
3. No additional dependencies are required as all implementations use standard Python libraries

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning project, suggestions and improvements are welcome! Feel free to:
- Open issues for discussions about implementations
- Suggest new problems or topics to cover
- Provide feedback on existing solutions

## Project Status

This is an active learning project. New implementations and topics will be added regularly as I continue to learn and practice DSA concepts.

## License

This project is open source and available for anyone looking to learn DSA concepts.


### Glossary:

- Array: A collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
- String: A sequence of characters, stored as an array of characters.
- Prefix Sum: A technique that allows us to calculate the sum of any range in an array efficiently, with a time complexity of O(1) after preprocessing.
- Sliding Window: A technique that allows us to perform operations on a window of elements in an array, with a time complexity of O(n).
- Fixed Window: A technique that allows us to perform operations on a window of elements in an array, with a time complexity of O(1).
- Subset: A subset is any set of elements from the original array or string. The order doesn't matter and neither do the elements being beside each other
- Subsequences: A subsequence is a set of elements of an array/string that keeps the same relative order but doesn't need to be contiguous.
